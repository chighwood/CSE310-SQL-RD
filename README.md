# CSE330-SQL-RD

First Module for CSE330 - SQL Relational Database

# Overview

This project is a simple Python project that uses SQLite to add, update, delete, and view trips and activities that I add to it. I wanted to keep track of all of the camping activities
I do over the years. I want to create a database that allows me to keep track of the location I've gone camping or backpacking. There would be a table of what activity was done. There would then be another table that would have several details: location, when - the dates, what shelter I used, and favorite food eaten. You would be able to look up each by the activity and it would provide all of the data associated with it. Over time, I want to expand it with more details and a way to allow me to see it all in an application.

# Relational Database

I am going to be using SQLite and Python for my assignment. SqLite is a relational database that works well with Python and a good place to start when working with SQL.

# Development Environment

I used many tools doing this project but most of the infomation I got was from W3schools, Youtube, and ChatGTP. I used W3schools to find the information I needed to be able to code using Python and SQLite. Youtube was used to help me understand what I was doing and how the code would work as I wrote it. I used ChatGTP to help me find errors and give me more details about what was going wrong so I could find the mistakes I was making to fix them.

I used 2 programming languages, Python and SQLite. These were my choices because I hadn't worked with a database that was already connected to Python itself so it was an interesting process. I enjoyed learning how it worked and also setting it up. I did download a DB browser that helped me make the tables for my database that I could send the details to.

# Future Work

- I want to add more steps to save the data to the database so that everytime I open it, it is saved on there. It should allow me to upload it.
- I want to improve the code itself. There are a few places that are not as clear as I would like.
- I want to add more comments in areas that need a bit more context. So that non-coders can understand what code does what.
